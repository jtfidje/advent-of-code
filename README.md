# Advent of Code Solutions

**Author:** Jahn Thomas Fidje  

Here are my Advent of Code solutions!  

I will try to give solutions in both Python and Rust, but with the following "limitations":

## Python
I am competing in a Private Leaderboard and Python is my main language. Therefore my solutions will, i suspect, be 'quick and dirty'. After / If I manage to complete the puzzles I will do some cleanup ( and add unit tests!), but I'll leave the solutions "as-is" to preserve the shortcuts I may have taken. 

I will initialize each days' puzzle using Poetry ( `poetry new [day_n]` ). Each day should therefore be quite simple to get working :)

For tests, run `poetry run pytest tests`

## Rust
This is the first time ever I'm writing rust _( Time of writing: 12.2021 )_. Therefore I suspect my Rust solutions won't be as pretty as they should, but hopefully there will be some improvement as I continue to solve puzzles!  

Similar to Python, I init. each days' puzzle using Cargo ( `cargo new [day_n]` ). I will also create unit tests for each puzzle using the provided examples :)

## Puzzle Input
I will include my puzzle input for each day in the project folders for both Rust and Python
