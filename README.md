# Advent of Code Solutions

**Author:** Jahn Thomas Fidje  

Here are my Advent of Code solutions!  


## Python
I am competing in a Private Leaderboard and Python is my main language. Therefore my solutions will, i suspect, be 'quick and dirty'. After / If I manage to complete the puzzles I will do some cleanup ( and add unit tests!), but I'll keep the original solutions aswell to preserve the shortcuts I may have taken. 

I will initialize each days' puzzle using Poetry ( `poetry new [day_n]` ). Each day should therefore be quite simple to get working :)

For tests, run `poetry run pytest tests`

I will include my puzzle input for each day in the project folders for all languages
