# Advent of Code Solutions
**Author:** Jahn Thomas Fidje  

Here are my Advent of Code solutions!  

## Python
I'm part of a Private Leaderboard, and Python's my go-to language. So, heads up: my solutions might be a bit 'quick and dirty' at first. Once I crack the puzzles (fingers crossed!), I'll tidy things up and throw in some unit tests. But don't worry, I'll keep the original solutions too â€“ you know, to show off my clever shortcuts!

I've got some custom template magic to kick off each day. If you're curious, you can check out the code in the `aoc-template` folder.
